.SH COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
When a user enters a command from the terminal or a file, the command is checked against three possible cases. 

First, the command is compared to existing aliases.

Second, the command is compared to built-in commands. This category of commands reside as executable code in the main source code that is used to initiate the Masu Shell. 

Third, the command is compared to simple commands. This category of commands reside as executable files in the /bin library. The /bin library is also listed in the PATH environment variable. When a simple command is invoked, the command is invoked in a child process that will terminate upon successful execution.
