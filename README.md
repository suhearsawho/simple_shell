## Introduction

"Simple shell" is a project to recreate shell in C using what we've learned up until now. While we can use a fair amount of pre-existing functions to build our shell most basic function-- such as strlen, strdup, etcetera -- have to be written by us, there are optional tasks to rewrite them.

Including our abilities to write a program in "C" this project is also meant to test our collaborative prowess and work ethic. As such we must work within the same GitHub repository, where communication is critical to avoid merge conflicts. Also, whiteboard and peer programming are also strongly encouraged and from our experience has worked wonders for our progress.

## Usage

### Basic usage

using marsu shell in interactive mode.
```
user@ubuntu:~ $ ./masu 
masu:~ $
masu:~ $ ls -a
.   .bash_history  .bashrc     .lesshst  .profile  .sudo_as_admin_successful  .viminfo  Betty     work
..  .bash_logout   .gitconfig  .local    .ssh      .test_file.swp             .vimrc    dotfiles
masu@:~ $ cd work
masu@:~/work $ 
```

using masu shell in non-interactive.
```
user@ubuntu:~ $ echo "/bin/ls -a" | ./masu
.   .bash_history  .bashrc     .lesshst  .profile  .sudo_as_admin_successful  .viminfo  Betty     work
..  .bash_logout   .gitconfig  .local    .ssh      .test_file.swp             .vimrc    dotfiles
user@ubuntu:~ $ 
```

## Description

MaSu gets its name for the first two letter of the collaberators MArtin and SUsan is so happens to also be the Finnish for guinea pig :lol:
The Masu Shell takes user input in two modes - interactive and non-interactive - and performs the proper course of action. 
In the interactive mode, commands are taken from the terminal. In the non-interactive mode, commands are piped from a file.
